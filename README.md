RESTART RUNTIME (ctrl+M) AFTER EXECUTING THE CELL WHERE LIBRARIES ARE INSTALLED AND UNINSTALLED
This is required because matplotlib 3.5 doesn't work properly for some reason

After restart, run cell which imports libraries. 
"Acquiring annotation" section is not to be run. It only shows how annotation was extracted from R .rds objects
Starting from the section 'Create AnnData' you can run everything consequently using 'Run After' option in menu (ctrl+F10)
